                      My long-term goal is to work in a software development
                      role that aligns with my passion, ideally in a hybrid
                      working setup. I want to find a position that allows me to
                      maintain a healthy work-life balance without constant
                      stress over deadlines. If I settle comfortably into a
                      role, I would like the flexibility to travel to places
                      I've always wanted to explore while working remotely.

                      time management, maintaining motivation, and balancing
                      study with wellbeing would be significant challenges.
                      However, I underestimated the role of emotional resilience
                      and self-compassion in my journey. I also learnt that
                      managing social connections and asking for help are more
                      important than I initially thought.

                      I was surprised by how deeply mental and emotional
                      wellbeing are intertwined with learning success. I found
                      that I tend to become overly self-critical when I
                      encounter difficulties, which can derail my progress.
                      Learning about Human Skills especially the recent content
                      on "original" and "second" operating systems which helped
                      me recognise these patterns and understand the importance
                      of adopting a more compassionate mindset. I also
                      discovered that I'm more capable of adapting than I
                      initially believed, once I give myself permission to take
                      breaks and seek support.

                      Some challenges I ran into were keeping up with exercise
                      and downtime when things got busy, and sometimes I let my
                      social connections slide even though they're really
                      important for my wellbeing. I also struggled with staying
                      focused when my motivation wasn't there. Going forward,
                      I'm going to make sure I schedule in regular breaks and
                      catch-ups with friends as part of my weekly routine. I'll
                      also try out some mindfulness stuff to keep myself
                      grounded and maybe find an accountability buddy to help
                      keep me on track also I'm working on seeing challenges as
                      just part of the learning process instead of being so hard
                      on myself about them.

                      Sticking to the plan helped me get my days more organised,
                      which cut down on stress and stopped me from burning out.
                      It also really helped me get better at being kind to
                      myself and not beating myself up so much. I noticed I
                      could focus better and just felt better overall when I
                      actually took the time to rest and reflect like I'd
                      planned. The plan gave me a clear structure for managing
                      my study workload while looking after my wellbeing.

                      Reflecting on Te Whare Tapa Whā, I realize my taha whānau
                      (family/social wellbeing) needs strengthening. I have
                      sometimes isolated myself during intense study periods,
                      which impacts my emotional support network. To deepen this
                      wall, I plan to deliberately schedule quality time with
                      friends and family, and engage more actively with my peers
                      at bootcamp for mutual support.

                      Currently, my key needs are stress management and
                      maintaining consistent energy throughout the day. To meet
                      these, I will practice mindfulness meditation daily,
                      incorporate movement breaks, and be mindful of sleep
                      hygiene. Additionally, I will use journaling to process
                      thoughts and celebrate small successes, reinforcing
                      motivation and wellbeing.

                      feel like internally (how might you know)? What do you

                      Externally, when stressed, I tend to become quieter, more
                      withdrawn, or noticeably less engaged. Internally, stress
                      manifests as tightness in my chest, racing thoughts, and
                      difficulty concentrating. Recognizing these signs early
                      helps me take preventive actions such as deep breathing,
                      short walks, or reaching out to someone for support. When
                      stressed, I need compassionate reminders and controlled
                      breaks to reset my focus.

                    <div class="message-body">
                      A simple yet powerful experiment I will try is starting
                      each day with three deep breaths before opening my
                      computer or beginning study tasks and I'll try do this
                      technique before doing every task. This practice
                      encourages mindfulness, calms my nervous system, and sets
                      a considerate tone for the day. I will journal the effects
                      to see if it helps reduce anxiety and improve
                      concentrations. I also bought a fitness watch to track my
                      health data: steps, sleep, heart rate, and daily activity.
                      This helps me stay active and look after my physical
                      wellbeing. I review the stats each night to see my
                      progress and adjust my routines if needed. These
                      experiments combine mindfulness and technology to support
                      balanced wellness and proactive self-care during and after
                      bootcamp.
