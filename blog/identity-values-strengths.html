                How My Culture Shaped My Values and Identity
              </h4>
              <p>
                Growing up with a strong Filipino culture deeply influenced my
                values. Being raised in a spiritual Catholic family shaped me
                into someone outgoing, kind-hearted, and joyful. Even though I'm
                naturally introverted and enjoy calm and quiet moments alone,
                the love and acceptance from the people around me gave me a
                positive outlook on life. Challenges didn’t bring me down;
                instead, they motivated me to stay optimistic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moving to New Zealand over seven years ago added another layer
                to my identity. I quickly appreciated how the Kiwi culture
                shares similarities with Filipino warmth and friendliness—they
                treat everyone like family, with respect and kindness. Living
                here, I've learned to respect all genders, races, and cultures
                and to truly be myself in a diverse community. This combination
                of cultures helped me grow into a respectful and open-minded
                person.

                <p>
                  <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Adaptability.</span> I
                  adjust quickly to new tools, frameworks, or changes in my
                  environment without losing focus. This makes it easier for me
                  to take on challenges in tech and keep up with the fast pace
                  of learning and development.

                <p>
                  <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Empathy & Teamwork.</span>
                  I notice when others are struggling and genuinely want to help
                  them succeed. By supporting my peers and valuing teamwork, I
                  create a positive, collaborative environment for shared growth
                  and problem-solving.
                </p>

                  >
                  I care deeply about doing meaningful, high-quality work
                  instead of just completing tasks for the sake of finishing.
                  This drives me to learn thoroughly and push myself to produce
                  the best results I can.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These strengths help me stay engaged, work well with others,
                  and remain open-minded as I progress. They also motivate me to
                  keep growing, even when things get tough or the material is
                  challenging.

                  >
                  I tend to overthink situations and let my emotions get the
                  best of me, especially during stressful periods. This can lead
                  me to second-guess my decisions or hesitate to share my ideas,
                  making group work and communication more challenging for me.

                  <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Self-Doubt.</span> When I
                  lack confidence, I struggle to express my thoughts clearly and
                  sometimes hold back from contributing fully. This can slow my
                  learning, as I might miss out on feedback or opportunities for
                  growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Perfectionism.</span> I
                  often aim for perfect results, which makes me afraid to fail
                  or try things outside my comfort zone. This can lead to
                  procrastination or spending too much time on one task,
                  sometimes at the cost of missing deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These challenges can make it tough to work with others, take
                  risks, and stay productive skills I know are important in
                  tech. But being aware of them helps me work on managing myself
                  better and improving my communication, which is important for
                  my growth as a learner

              <h4 class="title has-text-left">An Ethical Decision I Made</h4>
              <p>
                Back in 2015, during my final year of IT, I was under a lot of
                pressure to finish my thesis in just one week. I was developing
                an electronic device and an app, staying up late almost every
                night. Meanwhile, my teammates handled the project
                documentation, but their work had so many errors over 70% of it
                was incorrect or full of grammar mistakes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Seeing this stressed me out, and I even considered removing them
                from the team. But with advice from friends and family, I
                realized I needed to stay professional. I apologized for my
                reaction and helped them understand what was needed. Reflecting
                now, I’m glad I chose empathy over frustration. It taught me the
                value of clear communication and balancing emotions with ethics.

              <p>
                In a team project, we disagreed on implementing unit testing
                with Jest, a skill we were all weak in. One member wanted to
                skip it to save time, but I argued it would cause bigger issues
                later. I suggested we tackle testing in small pieces, pair up
                when stuck, and keep communication open. It worked even we
                didn’t cover everything, but we made progress without burning
                out It’s about balancing ideals with what’s realistic for the
                team.
