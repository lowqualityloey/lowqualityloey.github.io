              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
              ego due to the Human Skills learning?
            </h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I learned that my ego sometimes holds me back from asking for
                help worrying about looking less competent. I'm slowly letting
                go of that and seeing that reaching out is actually a strength.
              </li>
              <li>
                I discovered that I have a fixed mindset where I tend to avoid
                challenges to prevent failure or embarrassment. This has been
                stopping me from improving myself and has led to missed
                opportunities. I'm now slowly changing this approach to embrace
                challenges instead, finding inspiration in the benefits that
                come afterward, and continuing my growth and learning process.
              </li>
              <li>
                I realized after completing a Strengths Finder assessment that
                one of my strengths is caring deeply for meaningful,
                high-quality work. However, this strength stems from my weakness
                of self-doubt and overthinking situations. I've become more
                cautious and aware of not pushing myself beyond my limits to
                avoid burnout, allowing myself to take breaks when things feel
                overwhelming.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="title is-4">
              What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
              learning and programming?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Values keep me grounded reminding me why I'm doing this and what
              goals matter most. They help me make decisions when things get
              tough or confusing. Empathy comes in when I'm coding with others.
              It helps me understand teammates' struggles and perspectives,
              which leads to better communication. Self-awareness gives me the
              power to notice when I'm stuck mentally or emotionally, so I can
              take a step back and figure out if I need to reset or just take a
              break.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">
              What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Opening up about my weaknesses was tough. I'm a pretty private
              person, and sharing my doubts or admitting when I was wrong felt
              uncomfortable.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">
              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
              time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development
              Bootcamp course?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I think it's because programming isn't just a solo thing. Most
              real-world projects need strong teamwork, clear communication, and
              the ability to deal with feedback and setbacks.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">
              Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
              like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
              practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </h3>
            <p>
              No, it wasn't a waste at all. At first, I wanted to spend all my
              time tackling technical skills challenges, but I realised that
              being a good developer isn't just about knowing tech stacks - it's
              about handling stress, asking for help, and working well with
              others. I genuinely enjoyed the journey of learning more about
              myself, how I manage my emotions, and how I stay motivated.
